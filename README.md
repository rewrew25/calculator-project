Javascript, HTML, and CSS practice by creating basic calculator.

Skills practiced:
- JavaScript operations, callback functions, click events, iteration
- CSS grid, button styling, user-friendly colors

The calculator is able to hold onto a series of operations (>2) in order to provide a correct answer when the equals sign is clicked.
It can accurately handle percent, decimals, negative numbers, and operations: +, -, *, /
When a user attempts to divide by zero, a "nope" message appears.
